# email-bot
This is my first project on github. Made in python, it is an email sender bot, that sends an email every second, until it has sent 100 of then

I've used environment variables to hold my login and password, that are stored in my machine, that way it does not appear in the code. The email message libriry was used to make the formatting of the email easier to read in the code. To send the emails i used the SMTP library.
